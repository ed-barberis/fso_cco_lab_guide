## Introduction

Monitoring Cloud Native Applications is crucial for ensuring optimal performance, availability, and user experience. However, the dynamic and distributed nature of these applications introduces challenges. Traditional monitoring tools often fall short in providing the real-time insights needed to understand complex interactions between microservices, containers, and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Therefore, a specialized approach to monitoring is essential for effectively managing Cloud Native Applications.

## Observability of Cloud Native Applications
An observability backend for cloud-native applications should offer comprehensive data collection, real-time analysis, scalability, and user-friendly visualization:

- Modern APM: Troubleshoot distributed applications by analyzing MELT data and assisted by ML techniques
- Kubernetes Anywhere: Troubleshoot Kubernetes Deployment and correlation with services
- Multi-Cloud Services: Troubleshoot Database, Messaging and other cloud infrastructure services
- Cross-Domain Correlation: AI/ML, Alerting & Dashboarding
- Optimization & Insights: Optimize K8s workloads for cost, efficiency & risk.
- Open Standards: Natively support OpenTelemetry


In summary, effective observability is crucial for managing the complexities of Cloud Native Applications. Traditional methods often fall short, making a specialized observability backend essential for real-time insights and rapid troubleshooting. As we move forward, we'll dive deeper into the tools, best practices, and emerging trends that define this critical aspect of cloud-native development.
