## Introduction

Designed from the ground up to monitor cloud-native architectures at scale, Cisco Cloud Observability (CCO) sets itself apart from other solutions that have merely added cloud support as an afterthought. It is fundamentally built to scale seamlessly with the rapid pace of cloud adoption.

Cisco Cloud Observability provides a unified view of metrics, events, logs, and traces (MELT), enabling you to pinpoint, assess, and resolve issues as well as evaluate performance bottlenecks. Additional capabilities encompass:

- Scalable observability tailored for cloud-native architectures.
- Integrated full-stack insights that span multiple domains and data categories.
- Extensibility through OpenTelemetry compatibility.
